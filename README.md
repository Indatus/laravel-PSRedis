# Laravel-PSRedis

__! Only for laravel/lumen >= 5.4, for previous laravel/lumen versions use 1.* version of the package https://github.com/Indatus/laravel-PSRedis__

A simple sentinel/redis driver wrapper for laravel. 

The default laravel redis driver supports redis clusters, however, it does not support high availability with redis, which is where Laravel-PSRedis comes to the rescue. 

With Laravel-PSRedis you'll get all the laravel redis magic that you aleady have such 
as `Redis::set()` and `Redis::get()`, and even session, queue, and cache support using redis,
you'll just be able to leverage High Avaliability redis instances instead of a simple cluster.

We do this by asking your [Redis Sentinels](http://redis.io/topics/sentinel) the location of your master before creating our Redis bindings in the IOC Container. By doing this we ensure anytime your app has a connection to your redis instance, that connection is to master.

## Installation

### Installation for Laravel 5

You can install Laravel-PSRedis easily with composer.

```
    composer require paunin/laravel-ps-redis
```
<a name="configuration" />
## Configuration 

Next, just fill in your sentinel/redis server info in the `app/config/database.php` config files that already exist in your application. 

You may already have some default laravel config values in place in your database config file that looks like this.

```

    'redis' => [
        'cluster' => false,
        'default' => [
            'host'     => '127.0.0.1',
            'port'     => 6379,
            'database' => 0,
        ],
    ],
``` 

Just overwrite those with the values below and fill in your server info.

```
    'redis' => [

           /** the name of the redis node set */
        'nodeSetName' => 'sentinel-node-set',
        'cluster' => false,
        'password' => env('REDIS_PASSWORD', null),
        'database' => env('REDIS_DATABASE', 0),
        
        /** Array of sentinels */
        'masters' => [
            [
                'host' => 'sentinel-instance.domain.com',
                'port' => '26379',
            ],
            [
                'host' => 'sentinel-instance.domain.com',
                'port' => '26379',
            ]
        ],
    
        /** how long to wait and try again if we fail to connect to master */
        'backoff-strategy' => [
            'max-attempts' => 10, // the maximum-number of attempt possible to find master
            'wait-time' => 500,   // miliseconds to wait for the next attempt
            'increment' => 1.5, // multiplier used to increment the back off time on each try
        ]
    ];  
    
    
    
```

### The Service Provider

Finally, you just need to add the service provider to the providers array in `app.php` and comment or remove the
redis service provider. 

```
$app->register(LaravelPSRedis\LaravelPSRedisServiceProvider::class);
```
